Python Challenge. Module 3 of Data Science Bootcamp.
In this challenge, we analyzed two data bases: 

## PyBank: a script that analyzes financial records. 
This dataset has two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The script analyzes and returns:
* Total number of months in the dataset
* Net total amount of profit over the period
* Changes in profits over the period (and its average)
* Greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits over the entire period.
It prints the results and stores then in a txt file.

## PyPoll: analyzes votes from a poll and calculates the results.
This dataset has three columns: "Voter ID", "County" and "Candidate". The script analyzes and returns:
* Total number of votes
* A list of candidates with the percentage and the total number of votes each won
* The winner of the election
It prints the results and stores them in a txt file.

_Note: the function to print and save in a txt file used in both scripts is based on a snippet of code provided by Reed Hyde in class._
